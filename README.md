These are Tensorflow and Keras ML models written in Google Collab.
Part with the numbering was written during a course of Tensorflow.
Other part was written during university classes.

It contains models based on:
* NN regression,
* NN binary/multi-class classification,
* CNNs,
* Transfer Learning with EfficientNet and ResNet (feature extraction models and fine-tuning models)
